## **How to Build a Raspberry Pi Camera for Seamless WebRTC Streaming**

I recently completed a project using the Pi Zero 2 W and the Camera Module 3. My goal was to stream a live feed from the camera and use WebRTC to integrate it with HTML. After some trial and error, I found MediaMTX to be the best package for WebRTC. I wouldn't have been able to do this without stumbling upon a helpful Reddit post.

## Hardware & Operating System

- **Pi Zero 2 W**
- **Pi Camera Module 3**
- **Pi 12.5W Micro USB Power Supply**
- **Pi Zero Case**
- **SanDisk Extreme PRO SDHC And SDXC UHS-I Card**
- **Pi OS Lite (32-bit)**

## Making it all work

1. **Set up your SD card using Raspberry Pi Imager:**

   - **Device:** Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W
   - **OS:** Raspberry Pi OS (other) -> Raspberry Pi OS Lite (32-bit) (Bookworm, No GUI)
   - Configure settings to set up your user/pass and SSID for Wi-Fi.

1. **After the first boot, update your Pi:**

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt full-upgrade
    ```

1. **Install the libcamera apps (drivers for the camera):**

    ```bash
    sudo apt install libcamera-apps
    ```

1. **Test to ensure the camera is recognized by the Pi:**

    ```bash
    libcamera-hello --list-cameras
    ```

    > You should see output similar to this:

1. **Download and uncompress MediaMTX:**

    ````bash
    wget https://github.com/bluenviron/mediamtx/releases/download/v1.9.0/mediamtx_v1.9.0_linux_armv7.tar.gz
    tar -xvzf mediamtx_v1.9.0_linux_armv7.tar.gz
    ```

1. **Remove the LICENSE file (make sure to read it first): (optional)**

    ```javascript
    sudo rm -rf LICENSE
    ```

1. **Move the files to the correct locations and set permissions:**

    ```javascript
    sudo mv mediamtx /usr/local/bin/
    sudo mv mediamtx.yml /usr/local/etc/
    sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/mediamtx
    ```

1. **Modify the YAML configuration file:**

    ```bash
    sudo nano /usr/local/etc/mediamtx.yml
    ```

    Scroll to the bottom and add the following under `paths:`:  

    ```bash
    paths:
      cam:
        source: rpiCamera
    ```

    Ensure proper indentation (2 spaces per level). Save and exit nano (`Ctrl + O`, `Ctrl + X`).

    > `Optional`
    >
    > I also change `rpiCameraTextOverlayEnable = true` and I set a description in the `rpiCameraTextOverlay`. These settings are just above the paths in the rpi section. You can refer > to the documentation for this.

1. **Set up the service file:**

    ```bash
    sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/mediamtx.service >/dev/null << EOF
    [Unit]
    Wants=network.target
    [Service]
    ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/mediamtx /usr/local/etc/mediamtx.yml
    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    EOF
    ```

1. **Set up the daemon, enable the service, start the service, and check its status:**

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo systemctl enable mediamtx
    sudo systemctl start mediamtx
    sudo systemctl status mediamtx
    ```

    > The status output should look something like this:

    ![image](https://i.ibb.co/WfwyDXc/service-status.png)

1. **If you encounter any errors, check the service log file:**

    ```javascript
    sudo journalctl -u mediamtx.service
    ```

1. **Verify everything is working by visiting:**

    ```bash
    http://yourIPaddress:8889/cam
    ```

    You should see a live video feed.

    Hope this helps!
