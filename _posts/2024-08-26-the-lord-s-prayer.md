![The Lord's Prayer](/assets/img/the-lords-prayer.jpg)

O Birther! Father-Mother of the Cosmos, you create all that moves in light.

Focus your light within us — make it useful: as the rays of a beacon show the way.

Unite our "I can" to yours, so that we walk as kings and queens with every creature.

Create in me a divine cooperation — from many selves, one voice, one action.

Grant what we need each day in bread and insight: subsistence for the call of growing life.

Forgive our hidden past, the secret shames, as we consistently forgive what others hide.

Deceived neither by the outer nor the inner — free us to walk your path with joy.

From you is born all ruling will, the power and life to do, the song that beautifies all from age to age it renews.

Amen
